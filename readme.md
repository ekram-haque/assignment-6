1.What is the difference between var, let, and const?
<br>
 <strong>ans</strong>: var, let and const are used to declare variable in js. but they have key difference , var is a function scoped and you can re-assign and re-declare the value. let is a block scoped and you can re-assign the value but not re-declare the same scope. const is also a block scope but you can't re-assign or re-declare it. after ES6 ,the best practice is avoid the var and use let and const.

2.What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
<br>
 <strong>ans</strong>: forEach() loops through an array without returning a new one, map() transforms each element and returns a new array of the same length, and filter() returns a new array containing only elements that meet a condition.
